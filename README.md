# AI Designer

## Product Vision
AI Designer is an agentic design assistant that helps teams transform a raw communication request into a professional visual document.

The goal is simple: reduce the time spent staring at a blank page and accelerate the path from idea to approved design.

## What Problem It Solves
Design teams often receive incomplete or rough briefs, then lose time on:
- finding a starting visual direction,
- trying multiple design options under deadline pressure,
- handling repeated feedback cycles.

AI Designer is built to support this early creative phase with structure and speed.

## What The Product Is
AI Designer is not just a one-shot prompt.
It is a guided design agent workflow that:
1. Understands the raw demand and constraints.
2. Proposes multiple creative style directions.
3. Produces an improved layout while preserving required content.

Current focus:
- **Tri-fold dépliant (A4 landscape, recto-verso)**.

Next focus:
- **Flyers** and other communication formats.

## Product Principles
- Keep the original intent and structure of the brief.
- Preserve exact wording when required.
- Offer creativity through clear style options.
- Add validation checks to reduce hallucinations.
- Keep a human approval step before final output.

## Current Outcome
The project already demonstrates a first end-to-end flow:
- from draft/reference input,
- to style reasoning,
- to generated final layout output.

## Target Outcome
AI Designer should become a reliable "design copilot" for communication teams, producing high-quality first versions faster and making review cycles more efficient.

Long term, the ambition is to make outputs usable in real production tools (including Canva-oriented workflows).
